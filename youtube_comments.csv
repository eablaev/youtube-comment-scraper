Beautiful 🥰
Manifest s02e11 😍 thank you SYML.... Such wise words 😍
Beautiful words and voice!!!
One of my friends told me to listen this on the night of Mother’s Day to calm me down. To keep it short I was crying that night because Mother’s Day is difficult for me (my mom is alive) but we don’t have a good relationship with each other. And I was bawling my eyes out to a friend and they recommended I listen to this and breathe
I agree a broken is harder to fix. I just wish when u love someone the doesn&#39;t have to be drama.
heard this from Heartland season 14 episode 10 and that scene broke my heart 💔 beautiful song
Absolute perfection in this song
Haunting and beautiful.
CORONAVIRUS  TOOK MY LIFE.  Missed  song like this because I  stopped looking for  nice beautiful songs.  Hate CORONAVIRUS

Heartland brought me here. Stunningly beautiful.
"&quot;MAID&quot; brought me here. November 2021. (Maid is a 10 episode show on Netflix, &#39;inspired by a true story&#39;)"
Maid episode 10 brought me hear she was almost there happy ever after
What a time to be alive when there are perfect songs such as this.
"I just adore this song. To the heartbroken, you are loved. You are cared for. With or without anyone’s approval, you are more than enough. Wait in your pain. Feel your pain, heal from your pain. Breathe. Be you. Be perfectly you. Your match will come. Keep sending them light on their journey. You’re brave. And never alone. I want YOU to see this. Thank you again for this stunning find. ❤️🤍"
It’s so sad that the most beautiful music will never be played on the mainstream radio here in the US…💔
I heard this song on the new Tv show MAID on Netflix and I thought it was very beautiful
Imagine Jesus singing this to you
Beautiful!!!!
I don&#39;t understand how there is a single thumbs down.
heard this on Heartland season 14. had to come check out this amazing song ❤️
this song just popped up and not remembering the title I clicked on it and remembered it from that night that you needed someone and I was there when no one else was and I didn&#39;t want anything else in the world but for you to be happy and safe and idk how you did it but you moved on from what it seems like and I tried nothing but make you a better person I just hope you are happier
Perfect ❤️🙏

"This song is part of an advertisement, I used Shazam to find the song and artist. It&#39;s really beautiful."
"happy birthday to me, lea :)"
Well done Youtube - plant a plug for the next video bottom right of screen so I can&#39;t read the lyrics at the crucial moments. Duh!!!! Beautiful song/video ruined by constant advertising. GGGrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!
"I had the privilege of hearing SYML last night at the Columbia City Theater in Seattle. Wow. He&#39;s amazing live. Bryan&#39;s (or Brian - not sure on his spelling) voice speaks to my soul. I absolutely loved hearing the story behind this song.  Girl has been a blessing to our family too, in difficult times. Thank you SYML for sharing your voice, talent and stories.   Sam Pinkerton was a great opener as well.  She&#39;s got a great voice on her too.  Loved her set. Can&#39;t wait to see you live again. I&#39;m also looking forward to your album drop on May 3, 2019."
Can someone please make a instrumental of this with backing vocals? Xxx
such an underrated song 😌
Nothing better come in last decade! Im in love with music and voices
"Absolutely rubbish! The beats are great, but the lyrics show a lot of insight to a dark &amp; seedy mind."
So glad I came across your channel 🖤
